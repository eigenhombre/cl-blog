OK, so [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/organa][my existing blog software]] is working well enough.

But, it's kind of slow to run, with >100 blog posts. I could probably
optimize it... but... lately I'm getting interested in Common Lisp, so
what you'll find here is experiments in rewriting portions of the blog
software in that language. If nothing has been committed for awhile,
you can assume it's been (at least temporarily) abandoned. Cheers!
